;;; We use READ-SEQUENCE instead of READ-LINE to work around a bug in
;;; the proc file system on Linux kernel 2.6.x. The select() system
;;; call does not work correctly on certain files; it never reports
;;; that data is available for reading. Since CMUCL's fd-streams use
;;; select(), as a part of the SERVE-EVENT mechanism, normal I/O (for
;;; instance with READ-CHAR or READ-LINE) will fail on these files.
;;; Luckily READ-SEQUENCE does not suffer from this problem.
;;;
;;; We could also call "uname -r" here, but using the filesystem-based
;;; interface seems cleaner.
