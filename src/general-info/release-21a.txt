========================== C M U C L  21 a =============================

[In Progress]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 21a.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20f release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:
  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements

  * Changes
    * Micro-optimize SCALE-FLOAT to do multiplication when possible.
    * Update to ASDF 3.1.4.
    * The external-format :UTF is no longer an alias for :UTF-8.
    * :ELF feature added for solaris.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:
    * On ppc machines with clock speeds over 2 GHz or so,
      LISP::CYCLES-PER-TICK is no longer negative. This caused the
      cycle count from TIME to be negative.
    * EXTERN-ALIEN-NAME unified not to prepend an underscore if :ELF
      is a *FEATURE*.
    * Motifd will work as either a 32-bit or 64-bit app.
    * Various bugs in clm fixed:
      * Occasional RXmStringGetLtoR crash fixed.
      * Motifd text callback fixed.
    * Support for 64-bit time_t on NetBSD added. This allows cmucl to
      run on more recent versions of NetBSD.

  * Trac Tickets:
    * Ticket #54 fixed.

  * Other changes:
    * Cross compile scripts from x86 to sparc and ppc updated to work
      again to cross-compile from the current snapshot.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:


This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20f; you will need to recompile FASL files.

guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
