========================== C M U C L  20 e =============================

[In Progress]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20e.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements
 
  * Changes
    * ASDF2 updated to version 2.32.
    * DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO now has source-location information for
      the macro definition.
    * :ALIEN-CALLBACK added to *FEATURES* for platforms that support
      alien callbacks.
    * The sparc port can be built using gcc once again.
    * The old Cheney stop-and-copy GC supported on sparc once again.
      However, there are no plans on supplying sparc binaries with
      this GC.
    * For x86, optimize TRUNCATE when the second arg is a compile-time
      constant and use a multiplication instead of a division.  (Sparc
      and ppc already had this optimization)
    * The following *FEATURES* have been removed:
      * :COMMON (not used)
      * :CONSERVATIVE-FLOAT-TYPE (Always default to this in type
        derivation.)
      * :I486 and :PENTIUM (Always assume we're running on at least a
        Pentium.)
    * Update unicode to support Unicode 6.2.
    * Add MP:JOIN-THREAD, as given in ticket #77.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    * Attempts to modify the standard readtable or the standard pprint
      dispatch table will now signal a continuable error.

  * Bugfixes:
    * REPLACE and friends on strings were limited to strings less than
      the maximum possible size. This has been fixed so strings of any
      supported length can be handled.  (See ticket #66 and #68.)
    * A serious error in FILE-POSITION on streams using an encoding
      other than latin1 has been fixed.  See ticket #74.
    * Fix startup crashes on some Debian Linux versions.  This was
      caused by the release string not having a patch version.

  * Trac Tickets:
    * Ticket #52 reopened.
    * Ticket #66 fixed.
    * Ticket #67 fixed.
    * Ticket #68 fixed.
    * Ticket #69 fixed.
    * Ticket #70 fixed.
    * Ticket #65 fixed.
    * Ticket #71 fixed.
    * Ticket #72 fixed.
    * Ticket #73 fixed.
    * Ticket #74 fixed.
    * Ticket #76 fixed.
    * Ticket #79 fixed.
    * Ticket #77 fixed.

  * Other changes:
    * -8 option for build-all.sh is deprecated since we don't
      officially support 8-bit builds anymore.
    * Some small updates to the User Manual and CMU Internals
      documents to generate pdf files by default.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:
    * In make-dist.sh, the version is now optional.  If not given, a
      version is derived from the git hash returned by "git
      describe". 

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20d; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
