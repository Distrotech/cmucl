========================== C M U C L  20 e =============================

[In Progress]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20e.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements
 
  * Changes
    * ASDF2 updated to version 2.26.
    * DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO now has source-locationinformation for the
      macro definition.
    * :ALIEN-CALLBACK added to *FEATURES* for platforms that support
      alien callbacks.
    * The sparc port can be built using gcc once again.
    * The old Cheney stop-and-copy GC supported on sparc once again.
      However, there are no plans on supplying sparc binaries with
      this GC. 

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:
    * REPLACE and friends on strings was limited to strings less than
      the maximum possible size. This has been fixed so strings of any
      supported length can be handled.  (See ticket #66 and #68.)

  * Trac Tickets:
    * Ticket #52 reopened.
    * Ticket #66 fixed.
    * Ticket #67 fixed.
    * Ticket #68 fixed.
    * Ticket #69 fixed.
    * Ticket #70 fixed.
    * Ticket #65 fixed.

  * Other changes:
    * -8 option for build-all.sh is deprecated since we don't
      officially support 8-bit builds anymore.
    * Some small updates to the User Manual and CMU Internals
      documents to generate pdf files by default.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20d; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
