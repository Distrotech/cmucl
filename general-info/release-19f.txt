[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19f.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19e release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    - Fix bug in backquote printer.  If the variable is @foo, we want
      to print ", @foo" not ",@foo".  Similarly, for .foo, we want to
      print ", .foo" instead of ",.foo".

  * Bugfixes:
    - Compiler can now derive the rank of an array, even if the array
      is not simple.
    - Fix off-by-one bug in ~R which prevents printing numbers from
      10^63 to 10^66-1.  10^63 is a vigintillion.
    - The compiler and interpreter should now handle slot-value the
      same.  Previously, different results were returned for things
      like (slot-value foo :a).

  * Trac Tickets:
    - #13 fixed.  (format nil "~11,3,2,0,'*,,'EE" .9999) produces
      0.100e+1 instead of 1.000e+0.

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19e; you will need to recompile FASL files.

guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
