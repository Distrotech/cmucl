[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19f.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19e release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:

  * Trac Tickets:
    - #13 fixed.  (format nil "~11,3,2,0,'*,,'EE" .9999) produce
      0.100e+1 instead of 1.000e+0.

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19d; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cons.org/cmucl/> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
