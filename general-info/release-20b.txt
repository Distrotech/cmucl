========================== C M U C L  20 b =============================

[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20b.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 19f release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements:
    - Read operations using an external format of utf8 are now much
      faster.  Some simple tests on Linux shows that read-line now
      only takes 40% as much time.  Sparc shows 60% as much time.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:
    - On Unicode builds, printing of '|\|| and '|`| was incorrect
      because no escapes were printed.  This is fixed now.
  * Trac Tickets:
    #33: get-dispatch-macro-character doesn't signal errors in
      compiled code
      Fixed.

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20a; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cons.org/cmucl/> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
