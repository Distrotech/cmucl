========================== C M U C L  20 b =============================

[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20b.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 19f release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements:
    - Read operations using an external format of utf8 are now much
      faster.  Some simple tests on Linux shows that read-line now
      only takes 40% as much time.  Sparc shows 60% as much time.
    - ASCII external format added.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:
    - On Unicode builds, printing of '|\|| and '|`| was incorrect
      because no escapes were printed.  This is fixed now.
    - Fixed issue with SSE2 support.  The vops for complex +/- float
      would add random junk to the imaginary part of the result.
    - UNIX-SYSINFO was broken for Unicode builds, which affected
      MACHINE-TYPE and MACHINE-VERSION.
    - Type predicates for double-double float and complex
      double-double float arrays are now done inline.

  * Trac Tickets:
    #33: get-dispatch-macro-character doesn't signal errors in
      compiled code
      Fixed.

  * Other changes:
    - :freebsd4 is no longer a *feature*
    - Added UNIX-GETENV, UNIX-SETENV, UNIX-PUTENV, and UNIX-UNSETENV,
      in the UNIX package to allow access to these C functions.
    - OCTETS-TO-STRING has changed.
      o The output string is no longer automatically extended.
      o Parameters can be given to specify the start and end of the
        octet array and for the start and end of the string.
        (These all default to the beginning and end of the arrays.)

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20a; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
