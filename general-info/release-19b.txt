[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19b.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19a release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:
       
  * Feature enhancements:
      - Added a much faster and much less consy bignum printer and a
        faster bignum reader.
      - Extended REQUIRE to support *MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS* from
        SBCL.
      - NetBSD supported.
      - SIMPLE-STREAM fixes:
           o READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE for
             signed-byte/unsigned-byte 8 streams.
	   o Memory-mapped file streams.
      - Large file support for Solaris, so CMUCL can handle files
        larger than 2GB.
      - Support for Mac OS X.
      - A much faster GCD implementation.
      - A faster Karatsuba multiplier when the number of words of the
        bignums is not a power of 2.  (Break-even is still around 1500
        bits, though.)
      - New command-line switch -debug-lisp-search to show how lisp is
        searching for its core file.
      - DEBUG-RETURN implemented which allows you to return a value
        from function.  Only enabled with DEBUG 3.
      - Lazy sxhash on symbols implemented for ppc.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:
      - FILE-AUTHOR should signal errors appropriately.
      - CMUCL was computing the wrong value for some special functions
        when the argument was on the branch cut for the function.
      - MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND accepts &REST and friends in the var list.
      - When constructing logical pathnames, all components will be
        automatically upcased.  Needed for print/read consistency, and
        fixes an issue with ASDF and logical pathnames.
      - Numerous fixes to the float printer, including a new float
        printer.
      - Justification (~< ~>) works better.
      - ~V with the value of NIL in format strings is treated to mean
        as if it weren't given at all, as specified by ANSI CL.
      - Characters print consistently with ~:C and ~S.
      - Numerous bug fixes for pretty-printing and format strings.
      - Pathnames are now printed with #P instead of #p.
      - The types COMPLEX and (COMPLEX REAL) are the same now.
      - UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE returns RATIONAL for integer types
        now.  (CMUCL doesn't really have a (COMPLEX INTEGER) type).
      - When a pathname can't be printed readably, signal a
        PRINT-NOT-READABLE condition
      - Printing arrays readably was sometimes wrong.

  * Numerous bugfixes:
      - FFLOOR and friends preserve the sign of the arg, so -0.0 is
        returned for negative args.
      - EXPT sometimes returne NaN instead of 1 when the power was 0.
      - Weak pointers don't have O(n^2) GC behavior anymore.
      - X11 authorization changes to solve problems seen with servers
        that don't listen to TCP connection requests.
      - unix-read fix
      - The compiler would give an error on deriving the result type
        of RANDOM when the arg to RANDOM was a union type.
      - "~*~" was not being parsed to mean a wildcard version.
      - If a pathname has a version, but no name, we can't print it
        readably.
      - UNIX-GETPWUID implemented for Darwin.  Needed for FILE-AUTHOR.
      - The compiler no longer gives errors when deriving the result type of
        coerce when converting a integer to a float that would not fit
        in a float.
      - Fix bug in reading from streams with element-type SIGNED-BYTE
        for sizes greater than 32:  positive numbers were incorrectly
        being returned as negative.
      - REMOVE-DUPLICATES was not honoring the :START option.

  * Other changes:
     
  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Improvements to Hemlock, the Emacs-like editor:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:

  * Deprecated features:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19a; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
