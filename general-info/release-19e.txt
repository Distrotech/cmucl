========================== C M U C L  19 e =============================

[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19e.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19d release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    - BOA constructors with &AUX variables are handled better now.

  * Bugfixes:
    - Floating-point traps are now handled on ppc.  Previously, no
      traps were signalled and SET-FLOATING-POINT-MODES did nothing.
    - FILE-POSITION no longer returns negative values for mapped
      file-simple-stream's.

  * Trac Tickets:

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:
    - Forward-referenced classes are allowed.

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19d; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cons.org/cmucl/> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
