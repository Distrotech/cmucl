========================== C M U C L  20 a =============================

[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20a.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19e release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:
    - CMUCL sometimes gets "stuck" during compilation where it is
      trying to simplify the union of a large number of disjoint
      numeric types.  Previously, we handled the case of integer
      types.  Extend this to handle floats as well.
    - SXHASH was computing the same hash code for upper and lower case
      characters by upcasing the character.  This isn't necessary
      since the characters are not EQUAL, so make SXHASH return
      different values for upper and lower case letter.

  * Trac Tickets:
    #31: pathname bug with :case :common
    Fixed.  The common case is applied to each part of the directory,
    not to the directory as a whole.

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19f; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cons.org/cmucl/> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
