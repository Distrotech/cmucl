[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19c.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19b release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

      - Cross-reference information can now be saved to a fasl file.
      - COMPILE-FILE accepts the new keyword arg :XREF.  When non-NIL,
        cross-reference information found during compilation is saved
        to the fasl file.
      - UNIX-UNAME added for non-glibc2 platforms, which already had
        it.
      - Added annotation support to the pretty printer so various
        annotations can be produced in sync with the pretty printer
        output.  (From Matthias Koeppe.)  Arbitrary functions
        ("annotations") can be queued in sequence with characters that
        are printed to the pretty stream.  When the characters are
        forwarded to the target stream, the annotations are invoked at
        the right position.
      - Add a restart for ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST to retry directory
        creation if necessary.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:

      - FILE-POSITION on string input streams accept :START and :END
        for the position.
      - The default value for keyword args for deftype is '*, not NIL.
      - ED is now defined (but does nothing).  Loading hemlock will
        give you an ED that works.
      - DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) works for more cases
        now.
      - MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ now always returns the primary value.
      - (SETF MACRO-FUNCTION) and (SETF COMPILER-MACRO-FUNCTION)
        accepts the optional environment arg, as specified by ANSI CL.
      - PRIN1 no longer prints the sign of the exponent if it is
        non-negative. 
      - PRIN1 and ~E are consistent now when printing large numbers. 
      - Undefined-Function errors from funcalling special forms now
        have the cell-error name filled in correctly.
      - ENOUGH-NAMESTRING was not returning the shortest namestring
        when the defaults was #p"/".
        
  * Numerous bugfixes:

      - Regression in MRG32K3A benchmark fixed.
      - (format t "~8,2f" -0.0) has the right length now.  This
        happened because we didn't recognize -0.0 is negative.
      - Type derivation for FTRUNCATE is now consistent with what
        FTRUNCATE returns.  Main problem was that -0.0 is now returned
        by ftruncate instead of +0.0.
      - Some errors during type derivation are fixed.  We cause the
        offending function to return NIL to indicate unbounded.
      - Errors in callbacks when the integer arg is shorter than an
        int have been fixed.
      - ASIN and ACOS returns NaN when given NaN args instead of
        signaling an error.
      - FTRUNCATE will return a quiet NaN when given a signaling NaN.
        It also properly handles infinity too.
      - Fixed a bug in handling of alien enum types in structures.
      - (MAKE-PATHNAME :DIRECTORY '(:RELATIVE)) now prints as #P"./"
        instead of #p"", which is the printed form of (MAKE-PATHNAME).
      - Relative directories for MAKE-PATHNAME now have all "."
        elements removed.  This makes it consistent with the reader.
      - A warning is printed if an element of the directory component
        of a pathname consists of a string containing the "/"
        character.

  * Other changes:

      - Due to some bugs in modular arithmetic, generating either
        wrong code or much slower code, you can now disable modular
        arithmetic by setting c::*enable-modular-arithmetic* to NIL.
        This is a workaround pending a better solution.
      - Support logical pathnames when using LOAD-OBJECT-FILE.
      
  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
      - Build scripts should recognize FreeBSD automatically.
      - Should be able to build on either Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.4 using
        the default version of gcc.

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19b; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
