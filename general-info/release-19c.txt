[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19c.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19a release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

      - Cross-reference information can now be saved to a fasl file.
      - COMPILE-FILE accepts the new keyword arg :XREF.  When non-NIL,
        cross-reference information found during compilation is saved
        to the fasl file.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Numerous bugfixes:



  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:



This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19b; you will need to recompile FASL files.

guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
