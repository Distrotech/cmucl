[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19c.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19a release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

      - Cross-reference information can now be saved to a fasl file.
      - COMPILE-FILE accepts the new keyword arg :XREF.  When non-NIL,
        cross-reference information found during compilation is saved
        to the fasl file.
      - UNIX-UNAME added for non-glibc2 platforms, which already had
        it.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:

      - FILE-POSITION on string input streams accept :START and :END
        for the position.
      - The default value for keyword args for deftype is '*, not NIL.
      - ED is now defined (but does nothing).  Loading hemlock will
        give you an ED that works.
      - DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) works for more cases
        now.
      - MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ now always returns the primary value.
      - (SETF MACRO-FUNCTION) and (SETF COMPILER-MACRO-FUNCTION)
        accepts the optional environment arg, as specified by ANSI CL.
        
  * Numerous bugfixes:

      - Regression in MRG32K3A benchmark fixed.
      - (format t "~8,2f" -0.0) has the right length now.  This
        happened because we didn't recognize -0.0 is negative.
      - Type derivation for FTRUNCATE is now consistent with what
        FTRUNCATE returns.  Main problem was that -0.0 is now returned
        by ftruncate instead of +0.0.
      - Some errors during type derivation are fixed.  We cause the
        offending function to return NIL to indicate unbounded.


  * Other changes:

      - Due to some bugs in modular arithmetic, generating either
        wrong code or much slower code, you can now disable modular
        arithmetic by setting c::*enable-modular-arithmetic* to NIL.
        This is a workaround pending a better solution.


  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
      - Build scripts should recognize FreeBSD automatically.


This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19b; you will need to recompile FASL files.

guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
