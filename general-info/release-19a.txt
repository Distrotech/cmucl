[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19a.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 18e release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:
       
  * Feature enhancements:
     - Stack overflow checking added for FreeBSD/x86 and Linux/x86.
     - LISP:FIND-CLASS and LISP:CLASS-OF now return CLOS classes.  The
       symbols LISP:STARDARD-CLASS, LISP:BUILT-IN-CLASS, and
       LISP:STRUCTURE-CLASS name CLOS class.  It is no longer
       necessary to SHADOWING-IMPORT these from PCL when doing MOP
       programming, and it fixes some non-compliances as well.
     - Weak hash tables have been added for x86 systems.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Numerous bugfixes:

  * Other changes:

  * Numerous improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:
     - Gerd's PCL has been added, which fixes numerous bugs and ANSI/
       AMOP non-compliances, and adds various new optimizations (also
       see the CMU User Manual).
     - PCL's class hierarchy has been changed to conform to AMOP, for
       instance, GENERIC-FUNCTION is now a subclass of
       STANDARD-OBJECT.

  * Improvements to Hemlock, the Emacs-like editor:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
      
  * Deprecated features:
  

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
18e; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
