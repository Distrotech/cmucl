[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19d.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:

      - Destructive functions like nreverse that modify constant args
        will produce a warning.
      - Destructive functions like nreverse whose results are not used
        will produce a warning.
      - Pathnames that cannot be printed readably using #p"..." will
        now be printed using the CMUCL extension #P(...).  However,
        there are still cases where CMUCL cannot print pathnames
        readably, but these involve search-lists and patterns.
      - LONG-LONG and UNSIGNED-LONG-LONG are recognized types in the
        C-CALL package for signed and unsigned 64-bit integers.
      - A port of gencgc to Darwin/ppc has been made.  This still
        needs work, and is known to have some issues, but it compiles
        CMUCL without problems and runs maxima just fine.
      - TRACE supports tracing of FLET/LABELS functions.  Use (trace
        (labels foo bar)) to trace the labels function FOO in the
        function BAR.  This is currently experimental.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:

      - A reader-error is signaled if the number that is being read is
        too small to be presented.  We used to silently return 0.
      - WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING no longer modifies the index if
        WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING is not exited normally.
      - An error is signaled if a declaration is used as the name of a
        deftype, condition, or defstruct, and vice versa.
      - An error is signaled when trying to generate a namestring from
        a pathname with just a version component (other than nil,
        :newest, or :unspecific).  CMUCL cannot print that readably.
      - FLET and LABELS functions will catch errors in keyword
        parameters.  Previously, a keyword of NIL was silently
        accepted. 
      - Printing a zero using ~E will now include a trailing zero
        after the decimal point, as required by CLHS, 22.3.3.2.
      - DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) now works for
        structures of type list or vector. 
      - DOTIMES will execute the loop the specified number of times,
        independent of what the loop might do to the loop counter.

  * Numerous bugfixes:

      - LISTEN on DUAL-CHANNEL-SIMPLE-STREAM should work now.
      - Some numerical issues with the two-arg log function have been
        fixed.  (log 17 10f0), (log 17f0 10) and (log 17 10) all
        return the same result now.
      - DESTRUCTURING-BIND no longer causes an error when the list to
        be destructured is circular.
      - PEEK-CHAR for Gray streams handles end of file correctly now.
      - For the ppc port, the alignment of objects in alien structures
        now matches the PowerOpen ABI for Mac OS X.
      - For Darwin/ppc, CMUCL was not following the ABI when calling
        out to C varargs functions.  Now we always copy any float args
        to the corresponding int regs (or stack) as required by the
        ABI.  This isn't necessary for non-varargs functions, but
        CMUCL doesn't know functions which are varargs functions.
      - Callbacks with long-long args or results should work correctly
        now for Darwin/ppc.
      - DESCRIBE no longer depends on having PCL loaded.
      - Tracing with no encapsulation appears to be working now for
        ppc.
      - A simple interface to sysinfo(2) has been added for sparc.
        This is used to provide better values for MACHINE-TYPE and
        MACHINE-VERSION.
      - PARSE-TIME can parse times like "Tue Sep 7 18:56:57 UTC 2004"
        again.
      - The pretty-printer for MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND can handle
        malformed MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND forms now, instead of producing
        an error.
      - Callbacks on Darwin/ppc with a large number of args (more than
        8 integer args) should work correctly now.  (Previous versions
        would signal an error.)
      - DESCRIBE no longer says arrays are adjustable when they are
        not, and vice versa.
      - Disassembly of some floating-point instructions on ppc has
        been corrected to display floating-point registers instead of
        integer registers.

  * Other changes:

      - CMUCL catches more cases where it cannot print a pathname
        readably.  In particular when the pathname name contains "/"
        or ".", or when the pathname type contains a ".".
      - WITH-SLOTS and WITH-ACCESSORS are now pprinted like
        MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND instead of like WITH-OPEN-FILE.
  
  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
      - Build scripts should recognize FreeBSD automatically.
      - Should be able to build on either Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.4 using
        the default version of gcc.

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19c; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
